# React Application Documentation

## Overview
This modern web application is built using React, bootstrapped with Create React App, and integrates with the OMDB (Open Movie Database) API to provide movie-related functionality. This documentation will guide you through setup, available commands, and additional resources.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (latest LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- OMDB API key (for movie data access)

### Environment Setup
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
2. Add your API configuration:
```
REACT_APP_OMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://www.omdbapi.com
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repository-url]

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

## API Configuration
This application uses the OMDB API for fetching movie data. The API configuration is managed through environment variables for security.

Example API usage:
```javascript
const API_URL = `${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}?apikey=${process.env.REACT_APP_OMDB_API_KEY}`;
```

⚠️ **Security Note**: Never commit your API keys directly in your code. Always use environment variables.

## Development Commands

### `npm start`
- Launches the development server
- Access the app at `http://localhost:3000`
- Features hot-reload functionality
- Displays lint errors in console

### `npm test`
- Initiates test runner in interactive watch mode
- Executes unit tests and provides coverage reports

### `npm run build`
- Creates production-ready build in `build` directory
- Optimizes and minifies assets
- Generates hashed filenames for cache management
- Ready for deployment to production servers

## Advanced Configuration

### Ejecting (`npm run eject`)
⚠️ **Warning: This is a permanent operation**

This command removes the single build dependency and copies all configuration files directly into your project. Consider carefully before ejecting as it:
- Gives full control over configuration files
- Exposes all build tools and configurations
- Cannot be reversed
- Is not necessary for most deployments

Only eject if you need complete control over the build tools and configuration. The default configuration is suitable for most applications, from small to medium-sized projects.
